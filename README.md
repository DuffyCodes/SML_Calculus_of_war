# SML_Calculus_of_war
An example of SML/NJ code I wrote for a class

To run my program, open the SML REPL and type 
use "proj1.sml";
That will load the program and all of it's functions and code.
To iterate through each day, type:
use "runSim.sml";
This will print out the values of each day as they're calculated.
There is a count in the list that tells you which day you've just printed.
